# What is RandomTown ?

RandomTown is a project made to help people discover open-source.
The intended goal is to get a few town in a JSON file and to use it later for a small application.
The simplest way to contribute is to add a town, a picture and a description.
In the end, we hope to get a list of towns randomly choose by contributors !
